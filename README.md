# unfinish-portfolio

Had a bunch of ideas for a portfolio, and I just wanted to share the beginning stages. I'm sure this will look nothing like the final version lol but I enjoy sharing concepts, ideas, and before and afters. Looking forward to revisiting this unfinish-portfolio in the future and compare it to the final portfolio "the portfolio that got me hired" 🤞🏾.
